        This has always been a part of the Russian elite's plans. Check out the book, Foundations of Geopolitics by Aleksandr Dugin, which is a book that details how Russia should approach increasing their sphere of influence. Finland's section reads:

        "Finland should be absorbed into Russia. Southern Finland will be combined with the Republic of Karelia and northern Finland will be "donated to Murmansk Oblast"."
          
        Finland will be next after this Ukraine crisis. At the section for Ukraine it reads:
        
        "Ukraine should be annexed by Russia because "Ukraine as a state has no geopolitical meaning, no particular cultural import or universal significance, no geographic uniqueness, no ethnic exclusiveness, its certain territorial ambitions represents an enormous danger for all of Eurasia and, without resolving the Ukrainian problem, it is in general senseless to speak about continental politics". Ukraine should not be allowed to remain independent, unless it is cordon sanitaire, which would be inadmissible."
        
        Their plan for the US is to:
        
        "fuel instability and separatism, for instance, provoke "Afro-American racists". Russia should "introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity, encouraging all kinds of separatism and ethnic, social and racial conflicts, actively supporting all dissident movements – extremist, racist, and sectarian groups, thus destabilizing internal political processes in the U.S."
        
        Think about "Russian troll farms" that continually stir things up on different social media platforms to get us, the American people, to be at each other's throats over such trivial things. Think about what it says for the UK:
        
        "The United Kingdom, merely described as an "extraterritorial floating base of the U.S.", should be cut off from Europe."
        
        and then think about how more research is coming out to show that Russian troll farms played a part in the Brexit vote as well. People treat them like "trolls" & not foreign digital attacks on the people of other nations aiming to cause instability.
        
        This needs to be a wake up call. This is Putin's game plan for the world. MAKE NO MISTAKE, it isn't the Russian citizens who want this. It's the Russian elites, it's Putin & his oligarchs who want this. And they won't stop with Ukraine. It's just one step in their plan.
